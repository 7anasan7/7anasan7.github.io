<div><h4>I still remember the dark dirty floor 
of the toy shed in the backyard. </h4>
The pain as every piece of clothing I had on
was getting torn off in fast motions. 
The hand covering my
mouth as I screamed for someone to help me. <br>
<h2>The help never came.</h2>


As I screamed with the sweaty hand over my mouth 
I thought that this was it, <br><br>
<h6>&lt;I was going to diex&gt;</h6><br><br>
I was only six years old, 
all my hopes and dreams were over, 
nothing pursued.

The pain was something I'd never felt before, 
it wasn't a cut nor a scrape. 
This pain would never go away or heal.
Then as if time stood still 
I lay there thinking what my parents would think 
when I told them what had happened. 
I tried so hard to get myself to safety, 
but I was weak, every move I made 
felt like the world was crashing down on me.

When really it was a fourteen year old boy crushing me
as he forced his way into my innocence. 
Taking away every purity I had 
and leaving me with pain and suffering. 

At that moment I prayed that I would die. 
For to live a life with this pain and wound that would never heal was 
unbearable. 
As I stopped screaming I thought I had died. 
The pain was still there but I felt a light shine on me. 
As I looked up I realized the torture was over, he had fled
the toy shed and went back into his house. 
I lay there naked in my own blood trying to figure out why this all 
happened, and why it had happened to me. 

To this day there isn't a moment that goes by that I 
don't think about that day in the toy shed. 
The pain and suffering still lurks in my head as I dream at night. 
It isn't forgotten and never will be, 
for that is how I learn and grow. 
Sharing and preventing is something I strive for.<br>

<h3>No one should feel that way.</h3> <br>
<h2>No one should cause that pain.</h2> <br>
<h1>For that pain lasts a lifetime.</h1><br>
